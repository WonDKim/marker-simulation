# Marker-Embedded Tactile Image Generation via Generative Adversarial Networks
We present a generative adversarial network(GAN)-based method for generating realistic marker-embedded tactile images in Gelsight-like vision-based tactile sensors.

## Data
The dataset used for training and evaluating the models are under `data` folder.
The uncropped raw data images are under `data/raw` folder.
