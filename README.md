# Marker-Embedded Tactile Image Generation via Generative Adversarial Networks
We present a generative adversarial network(GAN)-based method for generating realistic marker-embedded tactile images in Gelsight-like vision-based tactile sensors.
The trained generator in the GAN translates simulated depth image sequences to RGB marker-embedded tactile images.

For more information, please check the paper.

## Prerequisites
The project has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 & 18.04 with Python 3.7.

To install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Our project uses a physics simulator to obtain simulated depth images.
We use the MuJoCo simulator and require users to have it installed for using this project.
Information on the installation of MuJoCo can be found [here](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco).
